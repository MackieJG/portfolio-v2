The app was designed as way to help future CodeClan students to blog their experiences during their studies. Their was a focus on health and wellness as they went through this intensive course. The App uterlises GraphJS in various ways to highlight the progress the users were making day to day on their journey. The app was my first group project in CodeClan uterlising GitHub branching and experiencing what it's like to work on the same repo as other developers. We built the app in Javascript - React, CSS and uterlising RestAPI's to connect to our non-relational database via MongoDB. My may focus was developing the routes to the front end and handling the server.
