The app was designed to tackle the problem of inventory management with the coffee industry in mind. A way for coffee roasters to organise their stock and keep an eye on inventory levels. The app will provide alerts when stock are running low and when they're depleted. I built the web application in Python with the Flask framework connecting to MongoDB with RestAPIs. This was the first solo project I built as part of CodeClan's software development course. I learned a lot of the fundamentals of Python and it's capabilities.
