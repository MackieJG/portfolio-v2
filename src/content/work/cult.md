I was Cafe Manager at one of Edinburgh's specialty coffee institutions Cult Coffee Roasters. They featured numerous great coffee roasters from across the world as well as roasting some super delicious coffee themselves. I helped design their training structure, overseen the move to digital for all stock management and developed their food program. I helped foster a warm atmosphere for all customers to feel welcome and comfortable in the cafe and feel as if it was an extention of their home.
