Webhelp provided call handlers to numerous international companies to deal with a wide array of customer relations. I worked specifically on the BT Tech Fault campaign. With the emergence of Covid-19, the increase in BT services was noticeable through their tech fault department as people switched to working from home. It was my job initially to handle the customer calls on dealing with the technical faults. Very quickly I moved towards being part of their training team. I went through extensive training with the BT experts to become a subject matter expert (SME) for Webhelp. Anytime a manager had a complicated fault to handle, we were the team assigned to address the complicated nature of the fault.
